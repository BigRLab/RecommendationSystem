# RS Project

## Keras:
1. Read the code
2. establish the platform on Docker and Jupyter
3. Write the DSSM code: for semantic mode
4. Write the Multi-View DSSM code: for multiple dataset
5. Learn LSTM for the history model

## Read the code:
1. Start with the example and check the necessary doc file of Keras
2. Get to know file system /  directory setting of the

## Task1: Environment

build up the docker environment:
- docker image: jupyter/tensorflow-notebook
	jupyter
	python3
	theano
	tensorflow
- Keras: ruibo/jupyter_keras

- Write Dockerfile
 based on existed image
 create a new image with keras
 push on the repository of docker cloud

- pull the image
 run => create container
 learn how to use "run"
 port
 mounts the volume like U-flash
 give the name of container

---
## Task2: Keras and code
TODO:See the original code of Keras to learn more

----
## Task 3: run the basic model of DSSM
- create a local repo for the Project
- add note folder for recording the preprocessing
